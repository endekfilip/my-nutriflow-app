      <h2>🌱 Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>NutriFlow</strong> was born from a simple idea: nutrition shouldn't be complicated. 
        In a world filled with fad diets and overwhelming data, we wanted to build a sanctuary for 
        clarity. Our goal is to bridge the gap between complex nutritional science and your daily plate,
        giving you the power to make informed decisions without the stress.
